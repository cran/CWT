Description: Fast application of Continuous Wavelet Transformation ('CWT') on time
    series with special attention to spectroscopy. It is written using
    data.table and 'C++' language and in some functions it is possible to
    use parallel processing to speed-up the computation over samples. Currently, 
    only the second derivative of a Gaussian wavelet function is implemented.
